Point: both interfaces ok, clipping ok.
addp(point,10,10,0)

Line: both interfaces ok, clipping ok, known bug: sometimes divide by zero happens, but that doesn't crash the app.
addl(line,10,10,0;10,100,0)

Polygon: both interfaces ok, clipping ok.
addw(square,0,0,0;100,0,0;100,100,0;0,100,0,0-1-2-3)

remark: the thickness is very thin to allow for larger .obj files. It's the last parameter to super in the Wireframe
constructor (change from 0.1 to, say, 0.5).

Wireframe (using .obj): file chooser ok; clipping and rotation around (250,250,0) work ok.
teapot.obj is the lightest in terms of lag.

remark: to test mk4 and other large .objs, disable clipping (see Wireframe's update method).

Curve: clipping ok; use test_curves.oml to get a bunch of curves.

Surface: clipping ok; use test_surface.oml.
