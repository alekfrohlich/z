# TODO:
# Viewport transform
# Translation, Scaling and Rotation of world
# Dont allow things to resize? Scroll TreeView
# Is there a way to avoid repainting entire widget?
# Instantiate base class from superclass object
# Migrate to numpy
# Separate physical (Gtk) from conceptual (World) representation (Objects should draw themselves?)
# Is there a need for a ObjectFactory? Wouldn't we be better off only with World?
# Needs redraw annotation
# Why del?

# Future:
# Implement console logging
# Implement console controlling (World Manipulation Language - WML)
# Apply flake8 to codebase
# Fix requirements.txt
# Typed python?

# Challenges:
# Smoothening colinear points
